## Applications of Chatbot

   - Customer service: The chatbot can be used as an initial point of contact for customer inquiries, providing automated responses to common questions and routing more complex queries to human support staff.

   - Informational services: The chatbot can be used to provide information on a wide range of topics, from weather forecasts and news updates to answers to more specialized questions.

   - Language learning: The chatbot could be adapted to provide language learning exercises or quizzes, helping users to improve their language skills through interactive conversations.

   - Personal assistance: The chatbot could be adapted to provide personal assistance, such as scheduling reminders, making reservations, or even ordering groceries or other goods and services.

   - Education: The chatbot could be used in educational settings to provide students with interactive lessons and quizzes, or to provide feedback and support for online courses.

 
### Pros
  - The code is written in Python, a widely used and popular programming language.
  * The chatbot responds to different types of inputs, such as greetings, inquiries about the user's well-being, and questions asked by the user.
  + The chatbot uses the Wikipedia API to answer user questions.
  - The chatbot provides a default response when it doesn't understand the user's input.
  * The code is easy to understand and modify if needed, with each function focusing on a specific keyword or phrase and returning a corresponding response.

### Cons

  - The chatbot's responses are limited to specific keywords or phrases, which may not cover all possible user inputs.
  * The chatbot's use of the Wikipedia API may not always return the most accurate or up-to-date information.
  + The chatbot is limited to text-based communication and cannot respond to voice or visual inputs.

### Future plans
 
 - Our future plans is to make more efficient and not just to bound the program to specific responses.
 - This plan is my personal favourite, make an voice assistant bot.
